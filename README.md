# Setting Up a Python Application with Flask

When working on Python projects, managing dependencies and setting up your environment correctly is critical. This guide walks you through creating a Python application with Flask while ensuring your system's Python environment remains clean and conflict-free.

## Why Avoid System-Wide Python Package Installation?

Installing Python packages system-wide using `pip` in environments like Ubuntu can lead to compatibility issues. Modern Linux distributions manage Python environments to ensure stability. Direct modifications to the global environment might break system tools or updates.

Instead, we recommend using **virtual environments** or **isolated package management tools**. This approach ensures that your application dependencies are neatly contained and independent.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up Flask

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

A **virtual environment** is a self-contained directory that houses its own Python installation and dependencies. This isolates your project from system-wide changes.

To create one:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment
To use the virtual environment, activate it:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
Once activated, your terminal prompt changes to include the virtual environment's name, such as:

```bash
(venv) user@machine:~/your-project$
```
### 3. Install Flask
With the virtual environment active, use pip to install Flask:

```bash
pip install Flask
```
This command downloads and installs Flask along with its dependencies, contained within your virtual environment.

### 4. Verify the Installation
You can verify that Flask is installed by running:

```bash
python -m flask --version
```
python -m flask --version
If Flask is installed correctly, you'll see output like:
```bash
Flask 2.x.x
```
### 5. Deactivate the Virtual Environment
When you're done working in the virtual environment, deactivate it:

```bash
deactivate
```

Your terminal will return to its normal prompt, and the environment will no longer affect your system Python.

# Alternative Methods for Installing Flask
### Using ```pipx```

```pipx``` is a Python application manager that isolates installations in their environments automatically. It's perfect for globally managing Python tools or apps.

Install ```pipx```:
```bash
sudo apt install pipx
```
Use ```pipx``` to install Flask:

```bash
pipx install flask
```
## System-Wide Installation (Not Recommended)
If you absolutely need to install Flask globally, use the system package manager:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-flask
```
Or force installation with pip (risking system stability):

```bash
sudo pip install --break-system-packages Flask
```


Best Practices for Python Development
- Always use virtual environments to manage dependencies for projects.
- Keep your system Python installation clean to avoid conflicts.
- Use tools like pipx for globally required Python applications.
- Document your setup process in your project for team collaboration and reproducibility.

By following these practices, you'll create robust, portable Python applications while maintaining a healthy development environment. Happy coding!
